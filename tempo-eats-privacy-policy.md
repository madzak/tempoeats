# Privacy Policy for Tempo Eats

**Effective Date: January 27, 2025**
**Last Updated: January 27, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to Tempo Eats ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Tempo Eats mobile application (the "App") available on iOS and watchOS devices.

**The bottom line: We don't collect, store, or share your personal data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Information We Don't Collect

Unlike many apps, Tempo Eats is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle:

- **No Account Required**: You don't need to create an account or provide any personal information to use Tempo Eats
- **No Cloud Storage**: All your data remains exclusively on your device
- **No Analytics**: We don't use any third-party analytics services
- **No Advertising**: We don't show ads or use advertising identifiers
- **No Tracking**: We don't track your location, usage patterns, or any other behavior

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

Tempo Eats stores the following information locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch:

### Eating Session Data
- Timer settings and preferences
- Meal duration and timing records
- Bite interval history
- Custom user preferences for haptic feedback and notifications

### Health Data (Optional)
- If you choose to enable Apple Health integration, Tempo Eats may read and write health data including:
  - Mindful eating minutes
  - Dietary energy estimates
  - Meal timing information

This data is managed entirely through Apple's HealthKit framework and follows Apple's privacy standards. You have complete control over these permissions through your device's Settings app.

## How We Protect Your Information

### Local Storage Only
All data generated by Tempo Eats is stored locally on your device using:
- Core Data for structured information
- UserDefaults for preferences
- HealthKit for health-related data (if permitted)

### Device-Level Security
Your data is protected by:
- iOS and watchOS built-in encryption
- Your device's passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID
- Apple's sandboxing technology that isolates app data

### Data Synchronization
- Data syncs between your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework
- This synchronization occurs directly between your devices without passing through any external servers

## Your Control Over Your Data

You have complete control over your information:

### Deleting Your Data
- You can delete all Tempo Eats data by uninstalling the app from your device
- Individual meal records can be deleted within the app
- Health data can be managed through the Apple Health app

### Exporting Your Data
- You can export your eating history in CSV format for your records
- Exported data is saved to your device's files or shared using standard iOS sharing options

### Health Data Permissions
- You can grant or revoke HealthKit permissions at any time through Settings > Privacy & Security > Health > Tempo Eats
- Revoking permissions doesn't delete existing data from the Health app

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

**We don't share your information because we don't have it.** Since all data remains on your device, we have no ability to access, view, or share your personal information.

The only potential sharing occurs when:
- You explicitly choose to export your data
- You share data with healthcare providers using the app's export feature
- Your device's standard backup processes include app data (managed by Apple)

## Children's Privacy

Tempo Eats is not directed to children under 13. The app is designed for individuals managing their eating habits, particularly those who have undergone bariatric surgery or are working with healthcare providers on weight management.

## International Users

Tempo Eats stores all data locally on your device, regardless of your location. No data is transmitted to servers in any country.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be noted with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Since Tempo Eats doesn't collect user contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. Please review this policy periodically.

## Third-Party Services

Tempo Eats integrates with the following Apple services:
- **HealthKit**: For health data integration (optional, requires your permission)
- **WatchConnectivity**: For iPhone-Apple Watch synchronization
- **Core Location**: Only for the discrete dining mode feature (optional, requires your permission)

These integrations follow Apple's privacy guidelines and don't involve any third-party services.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:

- **Access**: You can access all your data directly within the app
- **Correction**: You can edit or update your information at any time
- **Deletion**: You can delete your data by removing the app
- **Portability**: You can export your data in standard formats
- **Restriction**: You control all aspects of data processing through app settings

## No Sale of Personal Information

We do not and will not sell, rent, or share your personal information. This is not just our policyâ€”it's technically impossible since we don't have access to your data.

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since Tempo Eats doesn't collect personal information, these rights are inherently protected.
